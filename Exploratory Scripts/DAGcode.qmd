## This markdown will contain the code used to create the directed acyclic graph created when thinking about this project

```{r}
#install and load packages
#install.packages('dagitty')
#install.packages('ggdag')
library(dagitty)
library(ggdag)
```

## Creating the DAG

Key:

FN - number of females near the nest

E1 - eggs in the nest

V - female visits the nest

OFS - other females spawn

FS - Female spawns

NMS - Nesting Male spawns

POSNK - presence of sneakers

NMAS - Nesting male aggression to the Satellite male

FDNS - Female does not spawn

NMASS - nesting male aggression to sneaker males

NMC - Nesting male courting

NMCA - Nesting male courtA

NMP - Nesting Male Presence

NMSPI - Nesting Male and Satellite POSNKitive interactions

NMSNI - Nesting Male and satellite negative interactions

SSH - Satellite shared spawn

SSNK - Satellite sneak spawn

SNS - Sneaker spawn

PD - Population density

SR - Sex Ration

POSA - Presence of satellite

SATC - Satellite courting

SATCA - Satellite courtA
