# Female Mate Choice and Spawning Behavior of the Ocellated wrasse.
This repository is for the r scripts, and markdown files for underwater behavioral data collected by members of the Alonzo lab during their work in Corsica, Fr, on the ocellated wrasse.
## Motivating Questions
The overarching question that motivates this project is, "What role does complex decision making play in female mate choice?"
  ### More Specific Questions
  How does the social environment influence female mate choice in *Symphodus ocellatus*?
  
  Are there major factors, or combination of factors, that female *S. ocellatus* use to make their mating decisions?
 
## Rationale
Mate choice plays a major role in the evolution of species, yet historically, research has focused on using the presence/absense of preferences in the choosing sex (in sexual reproductive systems) to explain the evolution of complex phenotyes and traits. However, in the last decade, behavioral research has shown that decision making is highly individualistic, with multiple factors (behavioral syndromes, developmental history, social ifluence to name a few) influencing differences in decision making between individuals(Rosenthal 2017). With mate choice being a type of decision making within choosing individuals, our usage of merely the presence/absence of mate preferences no longer makes the cut. Thus, this research sets out to understand the role of the social environment on the complex decision making process of mate choice.

## Target audience
Our target audience for this analysis is early year undergrads who are interested in getting research experience.

## Background Information
One consequence for being alive is dealing with trade-offs. Every choice that an individual is faced with has trade-offs between the options available to them. A key consequence that comes with trade-offs is the fitness cost(s) that come with the decision made. And these fitness costs can be directly selected for by both natural and sexual selection. Thus evolution is tightly connected to how individuals interact with these trade-offs. This means that understanding how individuals interact with trade-offs is crucial to understanding the processes of evolution.

One of the major trade-offs that species experience are mating decisions. Courters (the non choosing sex, usually male) provide different resources to the choosy sex (usually female), thus choosers must deal with the trade-offs that come from choosing between mates. One way that individuals can interact with trade-offs is to observe the decisions of others, also known as socail information.
Social information has been found to have a significant impact across species with processes like mate choice copying being highly prevelant across taxa. However, much of social information in mate choice research has focused on if individuals have the ability to learn preferences from observing others, rather than how individuals use social influence to make decisions under specific contexts. With high potential of informing what decisions individuals make, it has become increasingly important to research the effects of social information.

Enter *Symphodus ocellatus* a small wrasse that is found throughout the Mediterranean, Eastern Altantic, and Black Sea.

What makes the ocellated wrasse such an interesting study system for mate choice is the presence of three male reproductive tactics.

First, there are the nesting males, which build nests from algae, court and spawn with females, then provide parental care until all eggs in his nest hatch.

Then there are the satellite males, which for cooperative relationships with a nesting male during the courting and spawning phase, helping bring females to the nest and defend the nest. The satellite does this for the chance to spawn with the females, however his primary reproductive success comes from sneak spawning. When the nesting male begins the parental care phase, the satellite leaves to find another partner.

Lastly, there are the traditional sneaker males, who wait around a nest for a chance to sneak spawn while providing no parental care.

Interestingly enough, there are no known genetic determiners of which male an individual will be, and it has been found that growth rate during the juvenile stage plays a role in determining which reproductive tactic an indivudal will be. After their first year, males then "move up" to the nest tactic, i.e. sneaker males become satellites, satellites become nesting males. With a lifespan of 2-3 years, nesting males die after the breeding season.

If the multiple reproductive tactics weren't cool enough, there are also high levels of mate choice copying in this species. Nesting males are likely to be successful if a female observes other females spawning with or being around him and his nest. There are no known male traits or nest characteristics that drive female mate choice. Thus the social environment places a large role in the mate choice decision making process in this species.

The multiple male reproductive tactics and large amounts of mate choice copying in *S. ocellatus*, provide researchers the opportunity to observe the influencing effects of the social environment on chooser decision making!
