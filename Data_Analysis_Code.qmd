# Goals

## Broad question

What social factors are important in female mate choice?

## Specific question(s)

Do interactions with certain male reproductive tactics increase a female's propensity to spawn at a nest?

What is the relationship between number of sneakers at a nest and the propensity for a female to spawn at that nest?

# Models

### Generalized Linear Models

### Female visits/spawns as a function of Average Number of Sneakers

Based on our visualizations above, we can assume that a negative binomial distribution will be best for our data. This is because, while a Poisson distribution is based on counts, it has the assumption that the mean = variance. Based on our data, the variance is higher than the mean, thus a negative binomial is a better fit for our data.

```{r}
mean.var.table <- behavior_sheet_cln |>
  mutate(
    'average sneaker mean' = mean(behavior_sheet_cln$average_snk),
    'average sneaker variation' = var(behavior_sheet_cln$average_snk), 
    'female visits mean' = mean(behavior_sheet_cln$total_female_visits),
    'female visits sd' = var(behavior_sheet_cln$total_female_visits),
    'female spawns mean' = mean(behavior_sheet_cln$total_female_spawning),
    'female spawns sd' = var(behavior_sheet_cln$total_female_spawning)) |>
  dplyr::select(last_col(offset = 6-1):last_col()) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = 1:6, names_to = 'Which Value', values_to = 'Number') |>
  unique()

### Female spawns as a function of Her Interaction Pathway to the nest

#### Note:

While our data is based on counts, usually making model distributions poisson or negative binomial, we will be analyzing our data counts as binomial. This is because we are trying to see if the "interaction path", what social interaction the female had as she visited the nest, changes the probability of whether or not the female will spawn at that nest. Thus we can consider the number of female visits as the number of trials, with the probability of spawning for each interaction path being the probability.

#### Normalizing the pathways

By normalizing our pathways to the total number of visits, we are making each variable as a fraction of visits for each pathways, i.e. fraction of females that spawned which were brought by the SAT, fraction of females that spawned which were brought by the SAT and passed to the NM. This allows us to understand the probability of a certain pathway leading to spawning success.

```{r}
sheet.normalized <- behavior_sheet_cln |>
  #Normalize the different pathways by the total number of females that spawned
  mutate(
    #Nesting male brings pathway
    'fspawn.nm.b' = ((female_spawning_with_nm_brought_by_nm + female_spawning_with_only_sat_brought_by_nm)/total_female_spawning),
    #Satellite male brings pathway
    'fspawn.sat.b' = ((female_spawning_sat_brought + females_spawing_sat_brought_sat_only_spawn)/total_female_spawning),
    #Satellite male passes to Nesting Male pathway
    'fspawn.sat.b.p.nm' = ((female_spawning_sat_passed_to_nm + female_spawning_sat_passed_to_nm_but_only_sat_spawn)/total_female_spawning)
  )
  
```

#### Model

##### Prior simulations

```{r}
sheet.n.priors <- sheet.normalized |>
  mutate('nm.prior' = (sum(fspawn.nm.b, na.rm = T)/length(fspawn.nm.b)), 'sat.prior' = (sum(fspawn.sat.b, na.rm = T)/length(fspawn.sat.b)), 'sat.nm.prior' = (mean(fspawn.sat.b.p.nm, na.rm = T)/length(fspawn.sat.b.p.nm))) |>
  dplyr::select((c(`nm.prior`, `sat.prior`, `sat.nm.prior`)))


beta.select(quantile1 = list(x = 0.713, p = 0.5),
            quantile2 = (x =  , p = 0.5))

```

```{r}
fem.spawns.path.mdl <- sheet.normalized |>
  brm(data = sheet.normalized,
    family = binomial(link = 'logit'), #Tell model what type of distribution
    #Specifying the model
    total_female_spawning|trials(total_female_visits) ~ 1 + fspawn.nm.b + fspawn.sat.b,
    iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4, #Markov chain parameters
      seed = 4, #Determines which random numbers
      file = 'Data Analysis Outputs/fem.spawns.path.mdl') #saves it as an output
pp_check(fem.spawns.path.mdl)
print(fem.spawns.path.mdl, digits = 4)
plot(fem.spawns.path.mdl)
